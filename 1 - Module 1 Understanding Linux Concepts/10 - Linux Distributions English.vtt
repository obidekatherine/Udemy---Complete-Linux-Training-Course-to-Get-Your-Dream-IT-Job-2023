00:01.080 --> 00:09.150
Linux distribution, I will cover here all the Linux operating system and its flavors that are out there,

00:09.180 --> 00:15.090
the main ones and the popular ones, there are many, many of them, but a few of them that I captured.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.330
Here are the first one is RedHat.

00:18.630 --> 00:26.160
You probably have heard of Red Hat from many different sources, RedHat, as an enterprise level operating

00:26.160 --> 00:30.570
system that are being used by big, major companies.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.120
They do charge for the support.

00:33.210 --> 00:38.760
They do provide their own customized, reconfigured build operating systems.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.050
You cannot change it.

00:40.230 --> 00:41.700
It's not open source.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.640
And anything goes wrong with the operating system.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.100
RedHat can provide the support to fix it.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.650
Then the next one we have is sent operating system, which is sent OS.

00:52.650 --> 00:57.540
This is the operating system actually we will be working with in my course.

00:58.080 --> 01:05.970
And the good thing about learning centers is if you are planning to apply for a job on Linux after the

01:05.970 --> 01:12.060
course or once you gain some experience or whenever you are ready, you could easily find many jobs

01:12.060 --> 01:16.200
in rehab centers is exactly the same as RedHat.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.510
It is also managed by RedHat.

01:18.510 --> 01:21.900
They don't provide support on S.O.S and it's completely free.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.540
Then we have Fedora.

01:24.540 --> 01:30.990
This is also one of the popular operating system that is used by many companies.

01:31.630 --> 01:33.240
Again, this one is free.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.250
Then we have Susi.

01:35.400 --> 01:41.130
Sussie is very popular operating system in terms of customization.

01:41.430 --> 01:50.190
Many people uses this operating system and they change the code to give their proprietary appliances

01:50.190 --> 01:52.200
and their proprietary programs.

01:53.370 --> 01:58.650
A lot of companies like VMware also run Saussy appliances in their environment.

02:00.150 --> 02:07.770
Then we have Davian Tabin is very popular at the PC level and the last one is a Bunta.

02:08.100 --> 02:17.070
So all of these are major Linux distributions, a Linux operating systems that wanted to highlight.

02:17.700 --> 02:21.420
You will be hearing many of these names down the road.

02:21.960 --> 02:28.320
And our focus in this course is sent operating system, which is S.O.S.
