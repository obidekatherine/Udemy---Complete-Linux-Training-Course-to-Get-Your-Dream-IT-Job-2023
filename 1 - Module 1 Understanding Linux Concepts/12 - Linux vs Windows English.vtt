00:01.920 --> 00:03.450
Linux versus Windows.

00:03.810 --> 00:10.050
The reason I'm including this lesson in this training is because when you need to know a lot about a

00:10.050 --> 00:13.990
certain technology, it is good to compare one thing with another.

00:14.030 --> 00:23.070
Like whenever you need to compare, let's say, a car, you have to have a certain comparison with other

00:23.070 --> 00:23.710
cars.

00:23.730 --> 00:30.330
For example, if you are buying a mercedes, you should know a few differences between Mercedes and

00:30.330 --> 00:31.720
BMW and Audi.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.020
So this way you can make a right decision or you will know the features that you will be getting with

00:37.020 --> 00:37.800
your new car.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.870
So that's why I'm comparing Linux with Windows.

00:40.870 --> 00:47.320
So you will know exactly what the difference is, the basic difference, and you will be able to answer

00:47.320 --> 00:49.570
any questions that come up during the interview.

00:51.550 --> 00:55.390
The first difference between Linux and Windows is by the price.

00:55.540 --> 00:59.530
Of course, Linux is free and not all the distributions are free.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.430
Red Hat is not for you.

01:01.450 --> 01:04.710
You would have to pay for subscription support.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.870
Whereas Windows is free.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.490
You would have to pay for it.

01:10.030 --> 01:10.780
Is.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.430
Linux is not user friendly.

01:13.460 --> 01:18.110
You would have to run user commands to get your task in various windows.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.580
You have good way to do most of those tasks.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.770
All you have to do is double click run the program and you're done.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.240
Most of the things are done through the gooey reliability.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.240
Linux is very reliable.

01:29.270 --> 01:34.910
Oftentimes you it runs for months and years, but you don't even have to reboot it.

01:35.450 --> 01:36.430
In Windows.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.050
It often requires a reboot.

01:39.620 --> 01:43.310
Now Windows have done a lot better.

01:43.310 --> 01:48.980
Its operating system has become a lot better and stable where you don't need to reboot or it doesn't

01:48.980 --> 01:49.430
crash.

01:49.430 --> 01:51.690
Oftentimes software.

01:51.710 --> 01:57.470
Most of the softwares are enterprise level software that runs in Linux, whereas Windows there's a much

01:57.470 --> 02:02.570
larger selection of software, for example office games, utilities and a lot more.

02:03.410 --> 02:10.410
Also, Windows offers are like chat, chat and social media software's multitasking now.

02:10.430 --> 02:18.920
Multitasking is one of the basic reason why people came out with UNIX and the next type of operating

02:18.920 --> 02:24.620
system, because back then they needed some type of operating system that could perform multitasking.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.620
And for those who don't do not know what multitasking in terms of operating system, it's about running

02:30.950 --> 02:33.290
multiple processes at the same time.

02:33.560 --> 02:42.230
Whereas in Windows you could run multiple multitasking, but you do need a lot of CPU and memory.

02:42.890 --> 02:46.880
Now please do remember, I'm not trying to say Windows bad or Linux is the best.

02:47.110 --> 02:49.730
I'm trying to compare some of the basic features.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.670
Windows have done amazing job in the past few years where they have come up with the tools like Active

02:55.670 --> 03:03.150
Directory, domain controller, Microsoft Exchange and you ask your server running on Windows.

03:03.170 --> 03:07.520
They have done an amazing job and they have pioneered the market in that.

03:08.330 --> 03:12.410
So there are a few things that are very good in Windows and in Linux.

03:12.710 --> 03:16.730
They are in terms of programming security wise.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.200
Linux is very secure and Windows is somewhat secure.

03:21.200 --> 03:30.800
And why is that is because Windows is more vulnerable to to hacking, because it is facing the Internet,

03:30.800 --> 03:39.050
because people run like social media type of things or chatting sessions and a lot of different things

03:39.050 --> 03:42.530
that they run and they are there accessing the Internet.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.840
In Linux, you don't access the Internet.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.680
Open source Linux is open to public.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.090
There's the code is out there.

03:50.090 --> 03:55.730
You can modify the code, you can come up with your own operating system where it's windows, you cannot

03:56.240 --> 03:57.050
do anything.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.450
It is owned by Microsoft.

03:58.460 --> 04:04.490
You cannot have the code open or revealed to anyone.
