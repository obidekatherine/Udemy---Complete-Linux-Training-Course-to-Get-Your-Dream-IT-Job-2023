Let's look at Gen-X versus Linux and see what are the differences.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.550
But before we get into finding the differences, we'll find out what Unix is.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.740
Unix was first developed for multiuser and multitask purposes in mid 1970s in Bell Labs by AT&amp;T, G.E.

00:21.780 --> 00:24.100
and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

00:24.480 --> 00:31.230
There was an operating system, but it was not allowing for multi users or multitasking.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.840
So that was one of the purposes for creating that.

00:34.590 --> 00:44.460
Then born Linux in 1991 by a student named Linux towards Linux is mostly free.

00:45.960 --> 00:54.240
And Linux is open source, so what Linux free means is you could install the Linux operating system

00:54.240 --> 00:56.820
in any of your computer hardware.

00:57.150 --> 01:02.280
There are a few Linux distributions that are not free, like RedHat, where you would have to pay for

01:02.280 --> 01:03.540
support, a subscription.

01:04.290 --> 01:12.510
And the open source means that Linux code that was derived from Unix is actually open to the public,

01:12.510 --> 01:13.320
to the community.

01:13.500 --> 01:20.070
So they could go in and make changes to their code and make the operating system the way they want it

01:20.070 --> 01:21.690
to work in their own way.

01:22.860 --> 01:28.860
Unix is mostly used by Sun and the operating system is called Solaris.

01:29.220 --> 01:37.410
By the way, Sun is now bought out by Oracle and also other operating systems that are Unix is used

01:37.410 --> 01:42.690
as HP works by HP, IEX and some other distributions of Unix.

01:43.620 --> 01:53.130
Linux is used mostly by developer communities or companies like RedHat S.O.S, Debian, Fedora, Soucy,

01:53.640 --> 01:56.220
Bunta, and there are so many of them.

01:56.220 --> 02:01.410
Even if you go out and search for Linux distributions, you will find so many of them.

02:02.670 --> 02:07.130
Unix is comparatively support, very few filesystem.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.700
Now what is a filesystem?

02:08.850 --> 02:14.880
That is something that we will cover later, but there are fewer filesystem that supported by Unix operating

02:14.880 --> 02:20.820
system and a lot more vast systems that are supported in Linux.

02:20.820 --> 02:28.410
Flavour's Linux can be installed on a variety of computer hardware ranging from mobile phones, tablet

02:28.590 --> 02:36.570
video games consoles to mainframe and supercomputers is just like you cannot install Mac operating system

02:36.750 --> 02:37.950
on a Dell machine.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.380
You have to install Mac operating system on a Mac hardware just like that.

02:43.380 --> 02:50.940
Unix is only installed on certain hardware, whereas Linux you could install pretty much on every hardware

02:51.120 --> 02:54.590
that is out there running amd your Intel processor.

02:55.590 --> 03:02.070
So these are the few basics about Unix and and Linux and I hope you will find more information if you're

03:02.070 --> 03:03.410
curious about it online.
