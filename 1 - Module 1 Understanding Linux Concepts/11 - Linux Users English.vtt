00:00.630 --> 00:03.390
Let's look at who actually uses Linux.

00:04.980 --> 00:10.980
The US government and its agencies at the level of national, state, federal and international they

00:10.980 --> 00:18.870
use Linux and those agencies are such as FBI, IRS and many of the other agencies.

00:19.380 --> 00:23.310
Then we have NASCAR, National Aeronautics Space Administration.

00:23.310 --> 00:30.060
They run most of their computation platform on Linux operating system.

00:30.060 --> 00:37.200
So they also they're not only the user of Linux, they also contribute to the Linux source code.

00:37.200 --> 00:46.170
They so every time there is an update or there's a patch, they also add to that source of the patch.

00:46.590 --> 00:51.510
Then we have health care environment, for example, hospitals or even scientists.

00:51.510 --> 00:56.400
They use Linux to come up with the newer discoveries in the medicine field.

00:57.600 --> 01:04.920
Bullet train in Japan, which runs at a speed of 150 to 215 miles per hour.

01:04.950 --> 01:11.040
They run their platform that does the application, that controls that train.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.240
It runs on Linux traffic control.

01:14.250 --> 01:18.330
Many countries in the world are implementing traffic control, different methods.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.400
For example, they have cameras.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.890
So every time you break a light, a traffic signal, it takes your picture.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.180
And how does it happen?

01:27.180 --> 01:33.900
There is an application behind it which since the movement of your car and that application run on Linux

01:34.680 --> 01:41.400
Financial Institutes, for example New York Stock Exchange all they do their tradings they're trading

01:41.400 --> 01:48.420
platform applications are running on the NICS entertainment industries like cinemas, production houses

01:48.420 --> 01:52.650
and many other entertainment industries worldwide.

01:52.650 --> 01:59.850
E-commerce leaders, including Amazon, eBay, PayPal and Wal-Mart run their platform on Linux.

01:59.850 --> 02:06.930
So, for example, if you go to dot, dot, dot, dot, Amazon.com and the first page you see, which

02:06.930 --> 02:16.050
is a web server, that web server is actually running on an operating system and many other Fortune

02:16.050 --> 02:23.790
500 companies such as Google, IBM, McDonald's and Facebook and many, many, of course, that I cannot

02:23.790 --> 02:28.110
add them to this slide runs on the Linux operating system.
