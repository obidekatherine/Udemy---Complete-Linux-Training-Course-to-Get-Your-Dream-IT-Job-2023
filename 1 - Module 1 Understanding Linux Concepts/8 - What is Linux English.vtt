What is Linux?

00:03.260 --> 00:11.030
So of course, we are going to learn Linux, but we do want to know what exactly is Linux is an operating

00:11.030 --> 00:11.600
system.

00:11.630 --> 00:13.670
It's just like any other operating system.

00:13.700 --> 00:16.040
For example, Microsoft has Windows.

00:16.790 --> 00:21.530
Apple has Mac Sun, which is now owned by Oracle.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.880
They have Solaris running on Sparke Hardware.

00:25.520 --> 00:33.170
So Linux is an operating system which sits in the middle of your hardware and the users and the users

00:33.170 --> 00:36.670
are the one who run the applications.

00:36.980 --> 00:44.750
So it's like a middleman or a bridge that takes the commands from users and translate them to hardware.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.280
So look at this picture.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.050
So you see a computer, right?

00:48.290 --> 00:54.010
So without an operating system, this computer is considered like a dumb terminal.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.280
It doesn't do anything.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.560
So how does it work?

00:56.570 --> 01:01.690
So we have this terminal, which is, of course, a piece of brick.

01:02.090 --> 01:11.540
You open the tray of that computer, you insert your CD or DVD in that CD or DVD has the operating system

01:11.540 --> 01:18.170
image sitting on it, whether it's a Windows or whether it's Linux or whichever upbring system that

01:18.170 --> 01:18.990
you are installing.

01:19.430 --> 01:23.540
So you bought your computer from that operating system.

01:23.810 --> 01:27.920
So once you booting it up, it goes through the installation process.

01:28.310 --> 01:33.110
That installation process is going to ask you a bunch of questions like how do you want the operating

01:33.110 --> 01:34.460
system to be configured?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.920
How do you want your dissertation?

01:37.160 --> 01:41.610
How do you want how many users you want to have installed and so on.

01:41.930 --> 01:49.460
So once the installation is done, then at the end of the installation, it's going to ask you to reboot.

01:49.460 --> 01:55.490
You reboot the computer and it comes up to the Volcom screen and say welcome to Linux or welcome to

01:55.490 --> 01:58.690
Windows or whatever the operating system that you're installing.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.870
So then you could attach external devices to it.

02:02.870 --> 02:07.310
For example, you could attach keyboard to it, you could attach a mouse to it.

02:07.580 --> 02:17.870
So you use these mouse and keyboards, you type a certain command, certain, you use applications and

02:17.870 --> 02:21.050
type them, and then you send it to your operating system.

02:21.740 --> 02:28.670
Then your operating system takes those commands and forwarded to other hardware or other system peripherals.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.120
So some of them are, for example, the printer.

02:31.400 --> 02:37.100
So you if you are running an application, for example, you running Microsoft, would you type it in

02:37.100 --> 02:40.610
with your keyboard and then you want to print that document?

02:40.620 --> 02:40.960
Right.

02:41.180 --> 02:46.850
So the operating system will take that document and send it to your printer and your printer will spit

02:46.850 --> 02:52.330
out the document that you want to print or if you are running other programs, for example, you are

02:52.340 --> 02:59.510
online, you're checking your email or you are running some online program or even games.

02:59.720 --> 03:08.090
So you are using your keyboard or your mouse, you communicating with your operating system in the operating

03:08.090 --> 03:13.970
system, communicates with your hardware, and that's how it communicates to other devices on the network.
