00:00.940 --> 00:04.180
Thank you so much for enrolling in my course.

00:04.480 --> 00:05.860
I am honored.

00:06.910 --> 00:13.930
Now, if you have any questions along the way while you are taking my training, please do not hesitate

00:14.110 --> 00:19.510
to send me a text message or email me or whichever way that you prefer to contact me.

00:20.380 --> 00:29.200
Another thing I do want to ask you is that nowadays you do me ask you for a course rating or review

00:29.200 --> 00:30.400
very early.

00:30.790 --> 00:37.990
Probably you would watch my videos for 15 to 20 minutes and you will get a pop up window to rate my

00:37.990 --> 00:38.610
course.

00:38.620 --> 00:47.860
If you think that my course does not worth five star yet, then please click on Skip and have it remind

00:47.860 --> 00:49.450
you to the end of this course.

00:49.870 --> 00:54.760
Then you should decide whether my course worth five star or not.

00:56.570 --> 00:58.310
So let's get started.
