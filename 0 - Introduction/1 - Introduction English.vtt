Welcome to my course, complete Linux training course to get your dream it job.

00:09.690 --> 00:11.760
Now, let me put it in a very simple way.

00:12.330 --> 00:19.080
When you take this course, you will learn so many things about Linux that you're going to be able to

00:19.080 --> 00:22.560
apply for a Linux job and you will get the job.

00:23.040 --> 00:23.760
Fair enough.

00:24.660 --> 00:31.870
My name is Imran Afsal and I've been in it specifically in Linux field for more than two decades now.

00:33.240 --> 00:40.530
I have actually worked in New York City for fashion industry, for tech media firms, for financial

00:40.530 --> 00:43.770
firms, for cloud and hosting companies, you name it.

00:44.760 --> 00:52.320
I did complete my bachelors in Computer Information Systems from Baruch College, City University of

00:52.320 --> 00:56.910
New York and my MBA from New York Institute of Technology.

00:57.890 --> 01:07.630
I teach in a very simple language, and I don't assume that you know a little bit more about Linux.

01:08.330 --> 01:16.040
I will actually hold your hand every step of the way throughout this course, and I will make sure you

01:16.040 --> 01:17.840
understand everything.

01:19.190 --> 01:26.720

01:26.720 --> 01:34.010
any of the Linux certification and they were able to get the job of their dreams.

01:34.730 --> 01:36.260
