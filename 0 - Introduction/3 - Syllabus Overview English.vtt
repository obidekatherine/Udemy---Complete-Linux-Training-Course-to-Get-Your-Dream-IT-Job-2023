00:00.920 --> 00:07.520
Hello, everyone, I really request you to please give me five minutes to go over the syllabus together,

00:07.850 --> 00:12.920
because once you're going to go over this entire syllabus with me, you're going to know that this is

00:12.920 --> 00:15.890
the perfect and best course out there.

00:16.940 --> 00:17.360
All right.

00:17.390 --> 00:22.160
I have actually broken down my entire course in NetNet different modules.

00:22.550 --> 00:25.950
First module is about understanding Lennix concept.

00:25.970 --> 00:28.940
It will cover about Linux, Unix for Linux.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.070
And notice one thing.

00:31.070 --> 00:40.610
Every module I have, I have included quizzes for you to do, homework to do after each module and handouts

00:40.820 --> 00:41.510
to read.

00:41.510 --> 00:46.490
You don't really have to read each hand out, but it's good to have those resources in your hand.

00:47.060 --> 00:52.750
Moving on to module two where we'll cover, download, install and configure actual Linux machines.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.910
We'll talk about virtual machine downloading that virtual machine.

00:56.210 --> 01:02.030
We'll talk about what are the different ways to install a Linux machine that will cover the actual CentOS

01:02.030 --> 01:02.670
installation.

01:02.690 --> 01:09.290
I have also included the optional Red Hat Linux installation lecture as well, then some somewhat on

01:09.290 --> 01:15.830
Linux, desktop management on VM and then again ending with quizzes, homework and hand outs, moving

01:15.830 --> 01:21.320
on to module three, which is about system access and file system, and that is about Camonte problems

01:21.320 --> 01:23.870
accessing Linux system downloading install PUDI.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.140
You need to know some important things about Linux.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.880
I have covered that introduction to file system.

01:28.890 --> 01:30.920
What are the different file systems that are available then?

01:30.920 --> 01:39.020
The Basic Command CDPR and that's where we're going to start our Linux Canalis moving on to a file system,

01:39.260 --> 01:44.900
as you're going to see, I'm going to skip them of a very fast use review and go over it directly.

01:44.900 --> 01:50.660
Listing touch copy commands, binding files and directory wildcard softly Carelink quizzes, homework

01:50.660 --> 01:51.200
and handouts.

01:51.200 --> 01:57.470
Then Module four is about Linux fundamentals, commands and decks change what this is all about.

01:57.470 --> 01:58.880
Permission to file permission.

01:58.880 --> 02:06.080
Also, ACBL can access control, which is a detailed getting into the weeds, getting help tab completion.

02:06.080 --> 02:12.650
Adding text to the file pipe's file management commands display command filters command compare files.

02:12.650 --> 02:19.220
So many commands begin to learn in module four that is about Linux fundamental and combining splitting

02:19.220 --> 02:24.590
FAS, Linux vs. Windows and of course quizzes, homework and hand out module five system administration

02:24.590 --> 02:28.160
getting bit more into the actual administration part.

02:28.370 --> 02:34.160
We will talk about how we could v.i. a file difference between VM when said, which is substitution

02:34.160 --> 02:34.550
command.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.460

02:59.630 --> 03:01.970
reporter environment variable a lot more.

03:01.970 --> 03:04.490
I'm already getting out of breath and we still on module five.

03:04.490 --> 03:05.660
Moving on to module six.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.640
We'll talk about all about shell scripting.

03:07.640 --> 03:12.590

Module seven now working servers and the system updates.

03:16.310 --> 03:22.730
We'll talk about networking components, bonding network ports, downloading files from the Internet.

03:22.940 --> 03:31.250

03:31.250 --> 03:32.420

03:32.570 --> 03:34.730
I'm not just going to go away real quickly.

03:34.730 --> 03:39.470
I'm actually going to work with you to go ahead to download silent configure each of these servers.

03:40.310 --> 03:43.370

disk.

03:50.810 --> 03:56.330

Then Module ten just like resume.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.170
